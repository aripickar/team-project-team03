        My students are a diverse group of eighth graders who attend an urban, public elementary school in Northern California.
        My students come from a variety of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds and speak a variety of languages. They come to
        school with a broad range of learning experiences.My students are eager to learn and do their best. They want to be in school
        because they want to learn all they can to be successful one day. My students walk into our classroom every day full of life,
        ready to learn, and excited for what is in store for them that day!
